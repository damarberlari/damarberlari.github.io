        <h1>Why doctors are struggling to treat the gun violence epidemic</h1>
        <p class='meta'><b>Artikel</b> | 25 Juni 2016</p>
        <p>In the first 176 days of 2016, there have already been 196 mass shootings in America. Just two weeks ago, we witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in US history when a gunman killed 49 people in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Two days after the massacre, the American Medical Association released a statement calling gun violence in America a "public health crisis."</p>
        <p>Despite this statement, and similar sentiments or calls-to-action from the National Physicians Alliance, Doctors for America, American Public Health Association, and numerous other professional medical organizations, many politicians and citizens hesitate to see gun violence as a public health issue. The 193rd, 194th, 195th, and 196th shootings of 2016 happened this past Wednesday, the day Democratic members of the House staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control â€” one that was stymied by our government's political gridlock.</p>

        <p>Numerous factors, from the political muscle of the National Rifle Association to popular attachment to the Second Amendment, influence why so many people are reluctant to admit that 30,000 gun-deaths per year and twice as many injuries makes an epidemic. It is the leading cause of premature death in America, according to the APHA. By comparison, the Ebola epidemic that swept Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone last year killed 11,310 people total.</p>
        <p>The first is that for the past two decades the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been thwarted in its research on injury prevention and guns. In 1996, Congress eliminated the CDC's funding for firearms injury prevention research with an amendment to its appropriations bill. The amendment also forbids the agency from using other funding "to advocate [for] or promote gun control." The same language was added to the National Institutes of Health's funding bill in 2011. While such language doesn't make research around gun violence illegal, it makes it nearly impossible to fund. Which means it doesn't happen.</p>
