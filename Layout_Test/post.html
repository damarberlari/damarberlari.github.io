        <h1>Why doctors are struggling to treat the gun violence epidemic</h1>
        <p class='meta'>25 Juni 2016 oleh The Verge</p>
        <p>In the first 176 days of 2016, there have already been 196 mass shootings in America. Just two weeks ago, we witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in US history when a gunman killed 49 people in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Two days after the massacre, the American Medical Association released a statement calling gun violence in America a "public health crisis."</p>
        <p>Despite this statement, and similar sentiments or calls-to-action from the National Physicians Alliance, Doctors for America, American Public Health Association, and numerous other professional medical organizations, many politicians and citizens hesitate to see gun violence as a public health issue. The 193rd, 194th, 195th, and 196th shootings of 2016 happened this past Wednesday, the day Democratic members of the House staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control â€” one that was stymied by our government's political gridlock.</p></div>
